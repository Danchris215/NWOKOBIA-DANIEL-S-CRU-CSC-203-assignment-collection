    <h1>Conspiracy Theories in Football</h1>
        <p>
            The 2024 <cite>Ballon d'Or</cite> took place at Paris, France.
            It is one of the most anticipated and rewarding experiences
            for any football player. There were favorites to win this prestigious 
            award amongst whom were Vinicius Junior, Rodri from Spain and Jude Bellingham.
           
        </p>
        <p>
            News came out few hours before the winners had emerged that no Real madrid player
            attended the event. Even the head coach and owner of Real Madrid FC did not 
            attend the event. This was because they felt 
            <abbr title="Union of European Football Associations">UEFA</abbr> 
            was being unfair to them.
            They felt Vinicius deserved the award and even if it would have been given to a player from Spain based on 
            their conquest at the Euros, Carvajal should have been given the award.
         </p>
         <p>
            It has been filled with conspiracy theories of unjust treatment. Comments from prominent 
            figures also indicates this. Such comments include:
         </p>
         <q>
            Honestly, this award lost its credibility in 2018 when Cristiano did not win it- Zinedine Zidane
           </q>
           <q>
            The <cite>Ballon d'or</cite> and The Best are losing credibility-Cristiano Ronaldo
           </q>
           <blockquote>If the criteria of the award do not proclaim
            Vinicius the winner, those same criteria must
            proclaim Carvajal the winner.Since this has not been the case, it is obvious that the
           <cite>Ballon d'or</cite> and <abbr title="Union of European Football Associations">UEFA</abbr> 
           do not respect Real Madrid. And Real Madrid is not where it is not
            respected.- Unnamed Real Madrid source.
